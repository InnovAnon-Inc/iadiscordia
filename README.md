----------

- Adds craftable Discordian novelties used for spellcasting.
- Adds a Chaos Magick player skill.
- Use the craftitems on books and see what happens 3:)
- How spells work:
  - Player must write a title and text.
    The title is the name of the spell.
  - Spell formula is expected spell text salted with the book owner and hashed.
  - Player must correctly guess some number of hash digits for spell success,
    depending on Chaos Magick skill.
  - Now supporting spells with same title, different formulae => different results
- Spells sold separately.
- Learn painful lessons in security models, including:
  - Something you know
  - Something you have
  - Something you are
  - Salt
  - One-way/trapdoor functions

TODO
- on_use_node should allow to replace or alter node
- a magick item to act on players instead of nodes
- recipes for the stickers
