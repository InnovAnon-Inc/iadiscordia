----------

- Adds craftable Discordian novelties used for spellcasting.
- Adds a Chaos Magick player skill.
- Use the craftitems on books and see what happens 3:)
- How spells work:
  - Player must write a title and text.
    It would appear that the title is necessary to save the text.
    The title is not otherwise used by the mod.
  - Spell formula is expected spell text salted with the book owner and hashed.
  - Player must correctly guess some number of hash digits for spell success,
    depending on Chaos Magick skill.
- Spells sold separately.
